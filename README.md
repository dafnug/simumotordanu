For my Electric Motor Control System final project, I simulated the "Sliding Mode Control for PMSM Based on a Novel Hybrid Reaching Law." I utilized MATLAB to implement the proposed hybrid reaching law, which improved tracking performance and reduced chattering compared to traditional methods. The simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the new approach under various operating conditions.
